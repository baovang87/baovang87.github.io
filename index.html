          <h4>Goals</h4>
          <p>My major is either RN or Dental Hygienist. I'm almost dont with my all my classes before I can apply for the RN or Dental Hygienist program at FCC. Fall 2019 will be my last semester. I just hope that I can get into either program next year but what I really hoping to get into is the RN program. Once I'm done with either program I want to start work ASAP to help out my husband. He's been the only one providing (financially) for our family for the past 5 years. Most importantly is that I want to set a good example for my kids, to show them how important education is.</p>

          <h4>My Everyday Life</h4>
          <p>My everyday life consist of school and kids. I'm a busy mom but I tried my best to keep it together. I wake up take the kids to school, then I drop off my other two kids off at their grandma's house, and then I head out to school. After that I pick up my two kids from their grandma's place and come home and start cooking before my oldest gets out of school. On Monday nights I have to drove out to Madera for one night class and by the time I get home which is about 9:30 or later and then it's time for bed and then repeat. On the weekend I have to catch up on homework or studing for my classes. Life is crazy but I have people who loves and cares for me around to help me through it.</p>
